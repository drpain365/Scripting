The real differences are in the security and format. The config file /etc/vsftpd.conf specifies the format to be Exactly option=value, with NO additional spacing. 
anonymous_enable: public/private
chroot_local_user: chroot local users
Local_enable: allow local users to connect
Write_enable: allow users to “write” which means make changes to directories
ssl_enable: allow TLS/SSL sessions
chroost list(if only specific users are chrooted):
chroot_list_enable=YES
chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
secure_chroot_dir =/set/a/secure/chroot/dir

Anonymous server configs:
Anon_root: where the anonymous user’s home is 
no_anon_password=YES
Allow_writeable_chroot: may be necessary for error 500 
Anon_upload_enable
Anon_mkdir_write_enable
NOTE: You may have to set the directory permissions to 555

located at /srv/ftp. The files on the FTP server are business-related and should not be removed. The server should be configured 
to allow users to download files but not upload or modify files on the server. It should only allow anonymous connections. 
In addition, management would like to explicitly deny any ability to login to the FTP server as root. This should be 
configured using the current userlist file.
