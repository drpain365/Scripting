Remember to save the file after answering. The scored question appears below.

===============================================================================

Bodie wrote a simple program in C that added up some variables
and printed the resulting sum. The sum was used as a PIN number 
for his bank account. Unfortunately, Bodie has forgotten this PIN.
Rather than go through the arduous process of resetting the PIN, 
they have asked for your help in recovering the information.

When the C source code file (.c) was compiled, an object file (.o) 
was generated. An object file contains machine code that is used to
produce an executable program. Object files can be viewed with "objdump".

Unfortunately, Bodie says that the original source code, object file, 
and program have all been lost. However, he just happens to have saved 
some output from objdump as a text file. How convenient!
 
The file "sum_disassembly.txt" located on the Desktop 
is output from "objdump -S", showing the disassembly of the 
object file interleaved with data from the source code file.

At the time of the printf call, what are the 
decimal integer values of the variables w and z?

( EXAMPLE: 123 )
