The FTP server on this machine must remain operational. The FTP directories and files are located at /srv/ftp. The files on the
FTP server are business-related and should not be removed. The server should be configured to allow users to download files but 
not upload or modify files on the server. It should only allow anonymous connections. In addition, management would like to explicitly
deny any ability to login to the FTP server as root. This should be configured using the current userlist file
